          <p>Currently developing a quantitative investment strategy alongside a team of software engineering interns. The program is built in Python and implements data-cleaning and machine learning algorithms from scratch, leveraging Scikit-learn for cross-validation, as well as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation. The underlying strategy, inspired by some works in financial academic journals, aims to predict the movement of major market indices based on various consumer sentiment metrics, where overfitting is managed through feature-selection techniques.</p>
